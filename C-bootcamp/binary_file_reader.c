/* FILE: binary_file_reader.c
 * 
 * An example given during the C bootcamp session on Feb 22nd. 
 * Uses the binary file reading toolkit such as fopen with "rb"
 * and fread rather than the string-based operations like fgets.
 * This is so that we dont have to worry about special characters 
 * in the file and ensure we get all the header bytes.
 *
 * It should be a helpful start for Assignment 2 Question 1.
