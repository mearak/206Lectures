The files and programs in this folder are the "payload" that can be distributed by the web server. 
Any path that you type in your web address after the port number will indicate a file here.
For example:

localhost:<port>/Lecture_Example.html

Leads to the server accessing the "Lecture_Example.html" file in this folder.

If no filename is requested by the user, the default one is "index.html" in this folder.
